    <p>To code the lexical index we make use of five variables developed initially
in the Political Institutions and Events (<code>PIPE</code>) dataset
(Przeworski et al. 2013): LEGSELEC, EXSELEC, OPPOSITION, MALE SUFFRAGE, and
FEMALE SUFFRAGE. Since <code>PIPE</code> does not attempt to measure the
quality of elections, we generate a sixth variable: COMPETITION. All
variables are binary, coded 1 if the following circumstances obtain, and 0
otherwise.</p>
<dl class='dl-horizontal'>
    <dt>lied_country</dt><dd><p>The country name used in the original dataset. 2
country-years were repeated in the original data and have been dropped.</p></dd>
    <dt>lied_cow</dt><dd><p>The COW country code used in the original dataset.</p></dd>
    <dt>year</dt><dd><p>Calendar year.</p></dd>
    <dt>legselec</dt><dd><p>A legislative body issues at least some laws and does not
perform executive functions. The lower house (or unicameral chamber) of the
legislature is at least partly elected. The legislature has not been
closed.</p></dd>
    <dt>exselec</dt><dd><p>The chief executive is either directly or indirectly elected
(i.e., chosen by people who have been elected)</p></dd>
    <dt>opposition</dt><dd><p>The lower house (or unicameral chamber) of the
legislature is (at least in part) elected by voters facing more than one
choice. Specifically, parties are not banned and (a) more than one party is
allowed to compete or (b) elections are nonpartisan (i.e., all candidates
run without party labels)</p></dd>
    <dt>male_suffrage</dt><dd><p>Virtually all male citizens are allowed to vote in
national elections. Legal restrictions pertaining to age, criminal
conviction, incompetence, and local residency are not considered. Informal
restrictions such as those obtaining in the American South prior to 1965
are also not considered.</p></dd>
    <dt>female_suffrage</dt><dd><p>Virtually all female citizens are allowed to vote in
national elections. Similar coding rules apply.</p></dd>
    <dt>competition</dt><dd><p>The chief executive offices and seats in the effective
legislative body are filled by elections characterized by uncertainty (see
Przeworski 2000: 16- 17), meaning that the elections are, in principle,
sufficiently free to enable the opposition to gain power if they were to
attract sufficient support from the electorate. This presumes that control
over key executive and legislative offices is determined by elections, the
executive and members of the legislature have not been unconstitutionally
removed, and the legislature has not been dissolved. With respect to the
electoral process, this presumes that the constitutional timing of
elections has not been violated (in a more than marginal fashion),
non-extremist parties are not banned, opposition candidates are generally
free to participate, voters experience little systematic coercion in
exercising their electoral choice, and electoral fraud does not determine
who wins. With respect to the outcome, this presumes that the declared
winner of executive and legislative elections reflects the votes cast by
the electorate, as near as can be determined from extant sources. Incumbent
turnover (as a result of multi-party elections) is regarded as a strong
indicator of competition, but is neither necessary nor sufficient. In
addition, we rely on reports from outside observers (as reported in books,
articles, and country reports) about whether the foregoing conditions have
been met in a given election (see Svolik 2012: 24). Coding for this
variable does not take into account whether there is a level playing field,
whether all contestants gain access to funding and media, whether media
coverage is unbiased, whether civil liberties are respected, or other
features associated with fully free and fair elections. COMPETITION thus
sets a modest threshold.</p></dd>
    <dt>lexical_index</dt><dd><p>To generate the lexical index from these six binary
variables, a country-year is assigned the highest score (L0-6) for which it
fulfills all requisite criteria, as follows:
    L0: LEGSELEC=0 &amp; EXSELEC=0.
    L1: LEGSELEC=1 or EXSELEC=1.
    L2: LEGSELEC=1 &amp; OPPOSITION=1.
    L3: LEGSELEC=1 &amp; OPPOSITION=1 &amp; EXSELEC=1.
    L4: LEGSELEC=1 &amp; OPPOSITION=1 &amp; EXSELEC=1 &amp; COMPETITION=1.
    L5: LEGSELEC=1 &amp; OPPOSITION=1 &amp; EXSELEC=1 &amp; COMPETITION=1 &amp; (MALE
SUFFRAGE=1 or FEMALE SUFFRAGE=1).
    L6: LEGSELEC=1 &amp; OPPOSITION=1 &amp; EXSELEC=1 &amp; COMPETITION=1 &amp; MALE SUFFRAGE=1
&amp; FEMALE SUFFRAGE=1.</p></dd>

scheme sometimes indicates the common name of the country and (in
parentheses) the name of an earlier incarnation of the state: thus, they
have Germany (Prussia), Russia (Soviet Union), Madagascar (Malagasy), etc.

country ended on April 1975 (being absorbed by North Vietnam). It is also
<code>TRUE</code> for dates beyond 2012 for countries that did not end by then, depsite
the fact that the Gleditsch and Ward list has not been updated since.</p></dd> </dl>
    
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="deviations-from-pipe"><a class="anchor" href="#deviations-from-pipe"></a>Deviations from <code>PIPE</code></h2>

    
    <p>The LIED compilers state that:</p>
<p>Although we employ <code>PIPE</code> as an initial source for coding
LEGSELEC, EXSELEC, OPPOSITION, MALE SUFFRAGE, and FEMALE SUFFRAGE, we
deviate from PIPE—based on our reading of countryspecific sources—in
several ways. First, with respect to executive elections, in the
<code>PIPE</code> dataset "Prime ministers are always coded as elected if
the legislature is open." However, for our purposes we need an indicator
that also takes into account whether the government is responsible to an
elected parliament if the executive is not directly elected—a situation
generated by a number of European monarchies prior to World War I, by
episodes of international supervision such as Bosnia-Herzegovina in the
first years following the civil war, and by some monarchies in the Middle
East and elsewhere (e.g., Liechtenstein, Monaco, and Tonga) in the
contemporary era. To illustrate, <code>PIPE</code> codes Denmark as having
executive elections from 1849 to 1900 although the parliamentary principle
was not established until 1901. Before then, the government was accountable
to the king. Among the current cases with elected multiparty legislatures
not fulfilling this condition, we find Jordan and Morocco. In order to
achieve a higher level of concept-measure consistency, we have thus recoded
all country-years (based on country-specific accounts) for this variable
where our sources suggested doing so.</p>
<p>We also conduct original coding for countries whose coding is incomplete in
PIPE and for additional countries such as the German principalities that
are not covered in PIPE. In this fashion, we generate a complete dataset
for all six variables covering all independent countries of the world in
the period under study (1800-2013). Whereas the numbers of observations for
the PIPE variables range between 14,465 and 15,302, our dataset provides
18,142 observations for all variables. Except for minor adjustments
regarding executive elections (mentioned above), this additional coding
follows the rules laid out in the PIPE codebook. Coding decisions are based
on country-specific sources that are too numerous to specify. In rare
instances we stumbled upon information that required a re-coding of PIPE
variables, so the two datasets do not correspond exactly.</p>
<p>Countries are coded across these conditions for the length of their
sovereign existence within the 1800-2013 timespan, generating a dataset
with 221 countries. To identify independent countries we rely on Gleditsch
(2013) and Correlates of War (2011), supplemented from 1800 to 1815 by
various country-specific sources. Importantly, electoral democracy does not
presume complete sovereignty. A polity may be constrained in its actions by
other states, by imperial control (as over a colony), by international
treaties, or by world markets. Thus, to say that a polity is an electoral
democracy is to say that it functions as such for policies over which it
enjoys decisionmaking power. Scores for each indicator reflect the status
of a country on the last day of the calendar year (31 December) and are not
intended to reflect the mean value of an indicator across the previous 364
days.</p>

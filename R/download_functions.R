#' @section Methodological notes:
#'
#'   From FH's Freedom in the World methodology discussion:
#'
#'   Methodological changes have been effected periodically. For discussions of
#'   these changes, please consult the methodology essays for various editions
#'   of the survey.
#'
#'   For a full explanation of the current methodology, please consult the most
#'   recent edition of the survey.
#'
#'   "PR" stands for "Political Rights," "CL" stands for "Civil Liberties," and
#'   "Status" is the Freedom Status. Political Rights and Civil Liberties are
#'   measured on a one-to-seven scale, with one representing the highest degree
#'   of Freedom and seven the lowest.
#'
#'   Until 2003, countries whose combined average ratings for Political Rights
#'   and for Civil Liberties fell between 1.0 and 2.5 were designated "Free";
#'   between 3.0 and 5.5 "Partly Free," and between 5.5 and 7.0 "Not Free."
#'   Beginning with the ratings for 2003, countries whose combined average
#'   ratings fall between 3.0 and 5.0 are "Partly Free," and those between 5.5
#'   and 7.0 are "Not Free." Ratings for territories are not included in this
#'   table.
#'
#'   Several countries became independent, split into two or more countries, or
#'   merged with a neighboring state. Scores for these countries are given only
#'   for the period of their existence as independent states.
#'
#'   The survey years refer to the various editions of Freedom in the World,
#'   except for Jan.-Feb. 1973 through Jan.-Feb. 1977, which are from the
#'   bimonthly journal Freedom at Issue. The first Freedom in the World
#'   book-length survey was the 1978 edition.
#'
#'   For 1972, South Africa was rated as "White" (2,3 Free) and "Black" (5,6 Not
#'   Free). For Yugoslavia, ratings from 1999 to 2002 were for the country that
#'   remained following the departures between 1991 and 1992 of Slovenia,
#'   Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In February 2003, the Yugoslav
#'   parliament adopted a constitutional charter establishing the state of
#'   Serbia and Montenegro. Thus, beginning in 2003, Yugoslavia is listed as
#'   "Serbia and Montenegro."	The State Union of Serbia and Montenegro dissolved
#'   when Montenegro withdrew in June 2006, making Serbia an independent state.
#'   Thus, the ratings for Serbia and Montenegro are listed separately beginning
#'   in 2006.	 Kosovo was first listed as a territory beginning in 1992. Since
#'   2009, it is listed as an independent country. South Sudan was first listed
#'   as an independent country in 2011 after officially separating from Sudan in
#'   July 2011.	The former Zaire is listed under Congo (Kinshasa), and the
#'   former Western Samoa is listed under Samoa.

#' The Rulers, Elections, and Irregular Governance Dataset (Regime data)
#'
#' Bell, Curtis. 2016. The Rulers, Elections, and Irregular Governance Dataset
#' (REIGN). Broomfield, CO: OEF Research. The dataset, variable decriptions, and
#' technical notes, are available at
#' \url{http://oefresearch.org/datasets/reign}. The variable descriptions below
#' are taken from
#' \url{http://oefresearch.org/sites/default/files/REIGN_descriptions.pdf}
#'
#' @section Overview:
#'
#'   The REIGN regime characteristics dataset is based on the regime
#'   classifications of Geddes, Wright, and Frantz ([gwf_autocratic]), but it is
#'   updated monthly, and it has some differences with [gwf_autocratic]. These
#'   are described as follows in the online technical notes:
#'
#'   REIGN data is updated to the present month. We also added the following
#'   countries to the  dataset: The Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago,
#'   Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
#'   Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, Belize, Guyana, Surinam, Andorra,
#'   San Marino, Malta, Cyprus, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, Equatorial
#'   Guinea, Djibouti, Comoros, Mauritius, Seychelles, South Sudan, Bhutan,
#'   Maldives, South Vietnam, Brunei, East Timor, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu,
#'   Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Fiji, Tonga, Nauru, Marshall Islands,
#'   Palau, Micronesia, and Samoa.
#'
#'   We also added political systems that lasted for less than a year and
#'   specified start and end months. This allows for a more granular look at
#'   transitional periods and interim governments. These new short-lived regimes
#'   appear in countries including Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala,
#'   Peru, Benin, Niger, Ghana, and Nigeria.
#'
#'   Finally, GWF generally does not allow for yearly changes in institutions
#'   over the course of a regime. If a government begins as personalist, it
#'   stays personalist until that leader leaves power. In several cases we code
#'   a change in regime type following reforms during the tenure of a single
#'   leader, including Lanzana in Burkina Faso, Rawlings in Ghana, etc.
#'
#'   Further discussion of the differences between REIGN and GWF ([gwf_autocratic]) is
#'   available here: \url{http://oefresearch.org/sites/default/files/REIGN Data 2016.10.05.pdf}
#'
#' @param url The URL of the googlesheet where the REIGN dataset lives. Defaults
#'   to
#'   \url{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mrtORyhXw9TJMBYLAGPrikA4VDpla_Eq7L-NsEQ5VXg/edit#gid=1765819258}.
#'    This is fragile - if someone "unpublishes" the sheet,it may cease to work.
#' @inheritParams redownload_blm
#'
#' @return A [tibble] with the REIGN dataset, plus additional state system
#'   information generated by [country_year_coder]. The dataset has the
#'   following variables:
#'
#'   reign_cowcode: The COW code of the country in REIGN.
#'
#'   reign_country: The country name in REIGN.
#'
#'   gwf_casename: The case name in the [gwf] dataset.
#'
#'   gwf_startdate: The startdate of the case in the [gwf] dataset.
#'
#'   gwf_enddate: The enddate of the case in the [gwf] dataset.
#'
#'   Start: The start date of the regime.
#'
#'   End: The end date of the regime, or 31 December of the current year.
#'
#'   gwf_regimetype: The regime type. This is what the codebook says about the regime
#'   types:
#'
#'   DEMOCRACIES
#'
#'   We use a procedural definition of democracy, meaning we are interested in
#'   the institutional rules that dictate how leaders gain power and not in
#'   other correlates of democracy, including strong traditions of freedom of
#'   speech and assembly. Non-competitive single-party systems are classified as
#'   such, even if some are somewhat more liberal than others (see Botswana and
#'   Namibia). Democracies have reasonably free-and-fair competitions for
#'   political power.
#'
#'   1. Presidential Democracy: Democracy in which the executive is distinct
#'   from the legislative branch and considerable decision-making authority is
#'   granted to the executive. Presidential systems have presidents who serve as
#'   chief executives rather than figureheads.
#'
#'   2. Parliamentary Democracy: Democracy in which legislatures are more
#'   powerful and executives are less autonomous. Generally speaking, countries
#'   with powerful prime ministers and general elections are parliamentary
#'   democracies. Hybrid semi-presidential systems are classified case-by-case,
#'   but are usually grouped with parliamentary democracies.
#'
#'   NON-DEMOCRACIES
#'
#'   The Autocratic Regimes dataset by Professors Barbara Geddes, Joseph Wright,
#'   and Erica Frantz classifies all non-democratic governments into one of ten
#'   categories. Though our data differs from this dataset in important ways, it
#'   uses the same typology. We document major differences in the extended
#'   technical notes.
#'
#'   1.  Personalist Systems: Power is highly concentrated in the hands of a
#'   non-monarch dictator who is relatively unconstrained by a military or
#'   political party. Contemporary examples include Russia, Sudan, and Chad.
#'
#'   2.  Monarchies: Power is highly concentrated in the hands of a monarch who
#'   is much more than just a figurehead. Contemporary examples include
#'   Swaziland, Kuwait, and Morocco.
#'
#'   3. Single-Party Systems: Power is held by the head of a party. Executive
#'   power is effectively checked by the party or ruling committee. Contemporary
#'   examples include China, Angola, and Ethiopia.
#'
#'   4. Oligarchies: Power is held by the head of party, but unlike other
#'   single-party systems this party explicitly represents the interests of one
#'   elite segment of society. Past examples include apartheid-era South Africa
#'   and Rhodesia under Ian Smith.
#'
#'   5. Party-Personalist Hybrids: An intermediate hybrid where a party
#'   apparatus supports a dictator, yet the party's identity is concentrated
#'   around the person in power and it has few meaningful checks on executive
#'   power. Examples include Eritrea, and North Korea.
#'
#'   6. Military Juntas: A military committee runs the country. One officer
#'   typically serves as head, but this head serves the interests of the
#'   committee and his power is checked by other members of the military. Recent
#'   examples include Thailand and Algeria.
#'
#'   7. Indirect Military Juntas: The military has de facto power, but rules
#'   behind a civilian puppet. See pre-Mobutu Zaire and Suriname under Bouterse
#'   (1980-1988).
#'
#'   8. Personalist-Military Hybrids: A hybrid of military and personalist
#'   institutions in which a dictator holds most power and is relatively
#'   unchecked, yet the dictator's authority is rooted in military support.
#'   These systems often evolve from juntas when power is consolidated around a
#'   single individual. Examples include Chile under Pinochet, Pakistan under
#'   Zia and Musharraf, and Fiji under Bainimarama.
#'
#'   9. Party-Military Hybrids: Militarized single-party states in which most or
#'   all members of the ruling party are military elites. Examples include
#'   Algeria from 1962-1992, El Salvador before 1982, and Congo-Brazzaville
#'   between the 1968 coup and 1991.
#'
#'   10. Party-Personalist-Military Hybrids: A dictator rules with the support
#'   of a militarized single-party state, but is relatively unchecked by these
#'   institutions. Examples include Egypt after 1952, Indonesia under Suharto,
#'   and Syria under the Assads.
#'
#'   INTERIM PERIODS
#'
#'   Finally, we include four forms of government that are explicitly
#'   provisional or transitional:
#'
#'   1. Warlordism: occurs only in countries that are torn apart by conflict to
#'   the extent that they do not have a functional government. As of 2016, only
#'   Libya and Yemen meet this definition. War-torn countries like Syria are not
#'   included because a strong government continues to hold power in the capital
#'   and a significant part of the country.
#'
#'   2. Foreign-Occupied governments occur where foreign politicians or
#'   militaries hold de facto power over a government.
#'
#'   3. Civilian Provisional and Military Provisional governments are explicitly
#'   temporary arrangementsthat usually proceed completed transitions to
#'   democracy or follow coups and constitutional crises. Interim regimes are
#'   only called "military provisional" if the military is holding power until
#'   an election or some other formalized legitimizing event can occur.
